          we have been seeing that contemporary art today goes far beyond the
          framework of arts and crafts and fine art in the school classroom. It
          is a composite field with connections to all subjects, including
          language and literature, mathematics, science, and social studies. In
          each of these disciplines, researchers are exploring the “unknowns” of
          the world, delving into history, and making new discoveries and
          inventions from the past to the future in order to enrich our
          perception of the world.</span
